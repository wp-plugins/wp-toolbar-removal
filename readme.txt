== Add-On ==
[Toolbar Node Removal](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-toolbar-node-removal/), is the first add-on of [Toolbar Removal](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-toolbar-removal/), to make easly Node/Group removal, for specific Third Party Plugins Node Group, on future, without modify master code. To Removal of all "Text Links Alone" on Dasboard Backend and User Frontend, for any Plugin that put it on "Admin ToolBar", is simple  necessary, download install and activate only ToolBar Node Removal, and not ToolBar Removal, without loosing cache improvements on complex, and busy, WordPress installations. You can put ToolBar Node Removal, via ftp, to directory /mu-plugins/ and you activate automatically without any action, or needed refresh! Is also possible put ToolBar Removal, to directory /mu-plugins/ since first setup, and removal it is active, by default, before and after first installation of WordPress.
== Screenshots ==

2. The 'new' WP ToolBar: smaller, simpler, and bamboozled! No option to disable for back-end!
3. The 'old' WP Admin Bar User Profile Settings: full control ...
4. The 'new' WP ToolBar User Profile Settings: bamboozled! No option to disable for back-end!
