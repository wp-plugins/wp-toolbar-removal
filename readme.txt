== Screenshots ==
1. "Old" Admin Bar: bigger, clunkier, and redundant ...
2. "New" ToolBar: smaller, simpler, but redundant ...
3. "Old" Admin Bar Personal Options: full control ...
4. "New" ToolBar Personal Options: bamboozled! No option to disable for backend!
5. Admin Bar and ToolBar with "One Click Logout Barless" add-on Plugin ...
6. DashBoard with "WP ToolBar Removal": faster and user friendly ...
7. Personal Options: not needed if Admin Bar or ToolBar is disadled and removed!
